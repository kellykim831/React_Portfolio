    aboutTitle: "Responsive web design means making your customers happy. ",
    aboutPara: "I was born and raised in beautiful Monterey Bay. In 2006, I moved down to southern California where I attended San Diego State University. After graduating with a B.S in Hospitality and Tourism Management, I moved to Los Angeles to pursue my career in the fashion industry where I specialized in sales and marketing. After the Covid-19 pandemic hit, I decided to completely shift gears and change my career into the thriving tech industry. I am currently enrolled in a Full-Stack Web Development coding boot camp through UC Berkeley's Extension program. With my background, I am excited to announce that I will be carrying over these same qualities and principles into the tech field. I've always had a natural desire to service my clients and I'm known for providing great customer service, being in consistent communication, having strong attention to detail and ensuring a positive experience for all of my clients. With my professionalism, integrity and loyalty always coming first, I am devoted to taking the time to listen and learn about my clients needs, wants and desires. I will take the time necessary to help you achieve your goals and I'll do my very best as a web developer."
