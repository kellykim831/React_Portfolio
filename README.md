# React_Portfolio

 ## Description 
 My new updated portfolio was created with React. I have a header component that appears on multiple pages, a single project component that is used multiple times on a single page, a router and a footer component that appears on multiple pages.

## Process
 The react portfolio requires that the website has a polished look. The portfolio must have a mobile-first design, a nice color palette and a font size that is large enough to read. Lastly, the colors should not cause eye strain to those viewing my page.

 Here is a Gif of my react portfolio in action:

 ## Installation
 To create your own portfolio, you will need VS code and the dependencies are mdbreact, react, react-dom, react-icons, react-router-dom, react-script and web-vitals.
 
 ## Usage 
I am creating a portfolio so that I can showcase my hard work during my bootcamp at UC Berkeley Extension. I also want potential employers to view my work and gauge my knowledge in coding. I hope to impress an employer so that I can get an interview and work for their company one day.
